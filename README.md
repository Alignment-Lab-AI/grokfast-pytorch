## Grokfast - Pytorch (wip)

Explorations into <a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2405.20233v2">"Grokfast, Accelerated Grokking by Amplifying Slow Gradients"</a>, out of Seoul National University in Korea. In particular, will compare it with NAdam on modular addition as well as a few other tasks, since I am curious why those experiments are left out of the paper. If it holds up, will polish it up into a nice package for quick use.
